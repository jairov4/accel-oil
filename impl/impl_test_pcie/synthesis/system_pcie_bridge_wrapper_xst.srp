INFO:Xst:2117 - HDL ADVISOR - Mux Selector <var_be_cnt$mux0005> of Case statement line 0 was re-encoded using one-hot encoding. The case statement will be optimized (default statement optimization), but this optimization may lead to design initialization problems. To ensure the design works safely, you can:
   	- add an 'INIT' attribute on signal <var_be_cnt$mux0005> (optimization is then done without any risk)
   	- use the attribute 'signal_encoding user' to avoid onehot optimization
   	- use the attribute 'safe_implementation yes' to force XST to perform a safe (but less efficient) optimization
INFO:Xst:2117 - HDL ADVISOR - Mux Selector <var_be_cnt10$mux0005> of Case statement line 0 was re-encoded using one-hot encoding. The case statement will be optimized (default statement optimization), but this optimization may lead to design initialization problems. To ensure the design works safely, you can:
   	- add an 'INIT' attribute on signal <var_be_cnt10$mux0005> (optimization is then done without any risk)
   	- use the attribute 'signal_encoding user' to avoid onehot optimization
   	- use the attribute 'safe_implementation yes' to force XST to perform a safe (but less efficient) optimization

INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 16-bit shift register was found for signal <PCIe_Bridge/gen_pcie_bridge_64.pcie_bridge_64/sig_bar_request_sticky_hold_15> and currently occupies 16 logic cells (8 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL32 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.
