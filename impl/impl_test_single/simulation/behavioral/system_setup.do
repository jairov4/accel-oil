#  Simulation Setup DO Script File
#
#  The Simulation Setup DO script file defines macros and
#  commands to load a design and automate the setup of
#  signal displays for viewing.
#
#  Comment or uncomment commands in the DO files below
#  to change the set of signals viewed.
#
#  xcmdc and xcmds are used by the list.do and wave.do
#  scripts for error checking (user does not set them).
#  Set xcmdc variable to 1 when 'c' command is called.
#  Set xcmds variable to 1 when 's' command is called.
